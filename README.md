## Introduction

I learned to play chess as a child.

My grandfather Stanley taught me how to play chess.

Stanley is my mom's father.

He is Jewish.

My mom is Jewish.

I'm Jewish too.

I'm Jewish, Christian, and Muslim. I celebrate many religions.

I learned to play chess as a young child... I forget what age... maybe around 10.

I started beating my grandfather, but I was losing to my friend from elementary school.

My friend from elementary school took chess lessons with a chess teacher.

My mom bought me a chess lesson as a Hannukah present.

During my first chess lesson, my chess teacher taught me how to checkmate with a king and a rook.

After he taught me how to do it, I was able to remember the technique and use it in games.

Soon I started beating my friend from elementary school.

Then I got a new chess teacher.

In high school I started taking lessons with an international master.

The international master gave me a Russian book of chess puzzles. It had an elephant on the cover.

I solved puzzles in this book.

I took lessons with him.

I bought Mikhail Tal's book My Life and Games and read it on my carpeted floor.

I would sit on the carpeted floor with a chess board in front of me.

I bought Bobby Fischer's book My 60 Memorable Games and read this also on my carpeted floor, with my chess board in front of me.

I bought Yasser Seirawan's book Winning Chess Tactics. This book helped me learn tactics.

I actually learned a lot about tactics from Yasser Seirawan's book and Mikhail Tal's book.

I learned a lot about chess from all three books (the books by Mikhail Tal, Bobby Fischer, and Yasser Seirawan).

Soon I became very strong at tactics.

I became a very strong tactician.

I was winning a lot of games with tactics... but I didn't feel confident in the endgame.

So I applied myself in the endgame.

I bought Bruce Pandolfini's book Endgame Workshop in college and devoted myself to studying the endgame.

I traded queens willingly, in my blitz games on chess.com, just to reach an endgame, just to play an endgame.

I started winning equal endgames.

I learned, from studying Magnus Carlsen's games, that you can outplay your opponent in the endgame and win an equal endgame.

I became very confident at the endgame.

I became a very strong endgame player.

Soon I was a strong tactician and a strong endgame player.

I learned different openings and had trouble deciding which opening I wanted to play.

Many years later, in 2023 or 2024, I took Anish Giri's Chessable course on the Sicilian Dragon.

I developed a strong liking for the Sicilian Dragon, because it gives black attacking chances.

I settled on a repertoire of 1. e4 and 1... c5.

I played the Sicilian Dragon against 1. e4.

I'm still figuring out what to play against 1. d4, but I often play the Nimzo Indian.

I have taken many courses on the Nimzo Indian and I often like to fianchetto my queen's bishop to b7.

The main theme of the Nimzo Indian is 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4.

The move 3... Bb4 is really the characteristic move of the Nimzo Indian.

When I play the Sicilian Dragon as black, I am helped by a lot of theory.

I learned some key lines from taking Anish Giri's Chessable course on the Sicilian Dragon.

In general, I like to win a chess game as quickly as possible.

The move 1. e4 is very direct and it lets me win as quickly as possible.

The Sicilian Dragon and the Nimzo Indian give black excellent attacking chances.

When my opponent plays 1... e5 I like to play the Scotch Gambit.

The Scotch Gambit has many traps that black can fall for.

I like to win chess games as quickly as possible, and the Scotch Gambit is well suited to this ambition.

So as white I play 1. e4.

As white I play the Scotch Gambit against 1... e5.

As black I play 1... c5 against 1. e4.

As black I play the Sicilian Dragon against 1. e4.

As black I play both 1... Nf6 and 1... d5 against 1. d4.

As black I usually play the Nimzo Indian against 1... d4. But sometimes I play the Queen's Gambit Declined.

On rare occasions I play the King's Indian Defense against 1... d4.

I tend to play the Nimzo Indian against 1... d4.

So that's a bit about my opening repertoire.

What has really helped me over the years is learning tactics, endgames, and openings.

When I learned tactics it took me to a whole new level.

When I learned endgames it took me to a level above that.

When I learned openings I started winning games more quickly by making use of traps (like the traps in the Scotch Gambit).

So I have really benefited from learning tactics, endgames, and openings.

There's one more element I have not mentioned.

I have benefited a lot from learning strategy.

Strategy has also taken me to a whole new level.

I learned chess strategy from many sources, including:

1. Jeremy Silman's chess.com lessons on positional chess (Roots of Positional Understanding 1 & 2)
2. Yasser Seirawan's book Winning Chess Strategies
3. YouTube videos, chess streamers, chess commentators, et cetera

Learning positional chess (which in my opinion is synonymous with strategy) really took my game to a whole new level

In my family we say there are rules of positional chess

If we learn the rules of positional chess, it can take our game to a whole new level

Some of the key concepts in positional chess include piece activity, pawn structure, king safety, open files, weak squares, isolated pawns, hanging pawns, backward pawns, open positions, closed positions, attacking, defending, evaluating a position.

So I read a lot of content on chess strategy, and learned the rules of positional chess.

Honestly, these days, I spend most of my time studying strategy.

I learned tactics a long time ago.

I learned endgames a while back.

These days, I spend most of my time studying strategy.

I also study openings.

These days, I spend most of my time studying strategy and openings.

I feel like the cost-benefit analysis (where the cost is time and the benefit is improvement) really favors the subjects of chess strategy and chess openings...

So I spend most of my study time studying strategy and openings, because of the cost-benefit analysis.

When I study chess, I typically take Jeremy Silman's lessons on chess.com.

I take the courses called "Roots of Positional Understanding 1 & 2".

I also watch YouTube videos on chess openings.

I also take Chessable courses on chess openings.

So these are some of the ways I study chess.

Before I conclude, I would like to say one more thing.

As a child I learned that it's important to control the center.

Honestly, I have pondered this advice for many years... and I still don't know what it means.

Does control the center mean "occupy the center" or "attack the center with pieces"?

I have pondered this advice for such a long time and I still don't understand what it means.

So listen.

It might be that controlling the center is important...

But I'm not quite sure what it means.

There are many benefits to playing 1. e4.

It opens up a diagonal for the light-squared bishop.

It opens up a diagonal for the queen.

It provides shelter for a knight on f3, because black has no way of playing e4.

(If black played e4 it would dislodge the knight).

The move 1. e4 also helps you castle.

It brings you one move closer to castling.

So there are many benefits to playing 1. e4.

Does it control the center? Well, it does control the d5 and f5 squares.

But honestly...

The advice "control the center" doesn't make sense to me.

It's possible that there's an elegant way of explaining this phrase.

To this day, I still have not found it.

So I'll tell you the advice that I do take to heart.

I take this advice to heart: "Play the best move".

On any move there is one or more best moves.

If we play the best move on every move, then we're unstoppable.

If we play the best move on every move, then we can beat almost any chess player in the world, including the strongest computers.

So playing the best move is really good advice.

Sometimes there is more than one best move.

So what I really try to do is find the best move and play the best move.

If I can't find the best move, then I try to play the strongest move I can think of.

Sometimes I settle for a good move or a very good move, because I'm short on time.

But I really aim to play the best move on every move.

So the advice that really helps me, the advice that makes chess clear, is "Play the best move".

The rules of positional chess often help us identify the best move.

Tactical vision often helps us find the best move.

Over the years I have spent a lot of time learning tactics and strategy.

Tactics and strategy help me find the best move.

So listen.

This is a long introduction.

I'm going to keep it as it is.

I think it serves as a good introduction.

In this repository I am going to upload some of my chess games from chess.com.

I'll create a folder called "games" or something like that and put my chess games in this folder.

I can also create a folder called "lessons".

I can create lessons and put them in the lessons folder.

So those are two ideas I have for this repository.

I can upload some of my games, and I can also upload some chess lessons.

Thanks for reading.
