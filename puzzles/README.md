## Introduction

Puzzles are fun, and they're a great way to improve at chess.

In this readme I will present my reader with a series of puzzles.

Most of these puzzles, or all of these puzzles, are taken from my games.

I don't want to write a long introduction, so I think that we can start solving puzzles right away.
