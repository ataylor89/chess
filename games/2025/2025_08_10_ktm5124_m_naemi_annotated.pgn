Qh5 Qe7 9. Be3 {I really like this move. It allows a structural weakness (doubled pawns) but it also opens the f-file, if black chooses to trade bishops. Piece activity is so important that, in my opinion, it compensates for the doubled pawns. I actually end up winning the game because of the open f-file. It takes courage to play a move like this because it allows doubled pawns. But honestly, I am so good at tactics, and I am so good at endgames, that I'm not afraid to sacrifice a pawn or allow a structural weakness. I can win an endgame even if I'm down a pawn. I can win an endgame even if I have a weaker pawn structure. I'm so confident at tactics and endgames and really every part of chess that I'm not afraid to sacrifice a pawn or allow doubled pawns if it gives me an advantage in piece activity.} Bxe3 10. fxe3 Nf6 11. Qf3 O-O 12. O-O Bb7 13. Rad1 Rad8 14. Rd2
Qc5 15. Bb3 d5 16. Qg3 {This is the critical position. According to the engine, the position is roughly equal. But the position is extremely complicated, and there are many ways for black to lose. The move 16... d4 is losing because of 17. Rxf6. The move 16... Nxe4 is losing because of 17. Nxe4 dxe4 18. Rxf7. As you can see, black's knight on f6 is a target, and black's pawns on e5 and d5 are targets. Black has to defend and hold the fort. I reviewed this game afterwards and it turns out that 16... Qd6 is a strong defensive move for black. The move 16... Qd6 defends the knight on f6, the pawn on e5, and the pawn on d5. The move 16... Qd6 holds the fort.} d4 17. Rxf6 dxc3 18. Rxf7 {The move 18. Rxf7 is a beautiful move and it's the fastest way to win.} Rxf7 19. Rxd8+ Qf8 20. Bxf7+ {The move 20. Bxf7+ is the fastest and most precise way to win, because it allows me to keep the rook. If I had played 20. Rxf8+ then after 20... Kxf8 21. Bxf7 Kxf7 I have a queen against a bishop instead of a queen and rook against a bishop. By playing 20. Bxf7+ I am able to hold onto the rook.}
Kxf7 21. Qf3+ {The move 21. Qf3+ is the main point of 20. Bxf7+. It allows me to keep the rook.} Kg6 22. Rxf8 {I could have played 22. Qxf8 or 22. Rxf8. There is actually a forced checkmate for white but I missed it. It's hard to find a forced checkmate like this with little time. I have an overwhelming material advantage and I just have to be careful about the pawn on b2 after black plays 22... cxb2.} cxb2 23. Qf5+ Kh6 24. Qe6+ g6 25. Qb3 a4 26. Qxb2 Ba6
27. Qxe5 Bb5 28. Qf4+ Kh5 29. g4+ Kh4 30. Kg2 Bf1+ 31. Qxf1 Kxg4 32. Qf4+ Kh5
33. Rf7 g5 34. Rxh7+ Kg6 35. Qf7# {I was able to deliver a checkmate. In the position after 22. Rxf8 I had 49 seconds on my clock. I had to be careful about the pawn on b2 and I had to be careful with my time. The first order of business was capturing the pawn on b2 so that it cannot queen. The second order of business was to deliver a checkmate. There was a forced checkmate on move 21 but I missed it. But I knew that I would checkmate my opponent eventually because of my material advantage. Let's quickly review the game. On move nine I played 9. Be3. This move allows doubled pawns but, if black takes on e3, it also opens the f-file. I felt like the open f-file compensated for the doubled pawns. I felt like my piece activity compensated for my doubled pawns. I ended up winning the game because of the open f-file. When black played 16... d4, black blundered, because the continuation 17. Rxf6 dxc3 18. Rxf7 is winning for white. Instead of playing 16... d4, black could have played 16... Qd6, and the game would have been roughly equal. I think that move 16 was the critical position, because there were many ways for black to lose, and black had to find a strong defensive move that holds the fort. One of the reasons I uploaded this game, and one of the reasons I annotated this game, is that it demonstrates the importance of piece activity. The move 9. Be3 is not the engine's top choice, and it even gives a -0.51 advantage for black. But it's a tricky move that leads to a tricky position. I'm not afraid of a -0.51 evaluation because I'm so confident at tactics, strategy, and endgames that I feel like I can win an endgame  even when I'm at a material or positional disadvantage. I can just play more accurately than my opponent and take advantage of my opponent's mistakes. I can outplay my opponent in an equal endgame, or even in an inferior endgame, because I am so strong at tactics, strategy, and endgames. I know this might sound like bragging but, if it is bragging, I'm doing it for good reason. I have spent a lot of time developing my strength in tactics, strategy, and endgames, so that I'm confident in every position and so that I'm confident on every move. This confidence helps me sacrifice material when I think the sacrifice is justified. This confidence makes me brave. This confidence makes me play moves like 9. Be3 because, honestly, it's so interesting that I just had to play it. I wanted an open f-file, and I ended up winning because of an open f-file. So the moral of this game is that, if you really master tactics, strategy, and endgames, it can make you fearless, and it can give you the courage to sacrifice material when you think a sacrifice is justified. If you master tactics, strategy, and endgames, it helps you in every game and every position. If you master tactics, strategy, and endgames, it can help you feel confident in every position, and it can help you feel confident on every move. I wanted to explain my thought process, and I wanted to explain why I felt comfortable playing a double-edged move like 9. Be3. It's not the top choice of the engine, but it leads to a very interesting position. Thanks for reading. Today is Monday, August 11, 2025. I wish everyone a great day. I wish everyone a good week. Good morning if it's morning. Good afternoon if it's afternoon. Good evening if it's evening. Good night if it's night. Best, Andrew} 1-0
